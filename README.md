Friend Finder express app

The Friend Finder app allows a user to enter their name and picture and answer 10 questions that best suits their personality.  Once all the fields are answered the app will match you with a person that has similar answers to your own.  It will then display your match's name and picture.  The app will store your information that you entered so should another user add their information you could be their match.

The application is structured in the following way.  The pre-loaded friends are stored in an array in the friends.js file located in the data folder.  The public folder contains the html pages for the home page and survey page.  The routing folder contains the api and html route files which holds the logic to get and post data to the server by utilizing express commands.  The server.js file contains the server connection info.
